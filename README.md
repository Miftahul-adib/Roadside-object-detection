## About This Project


1. **Data Handling & Preprocessing**  
   - Collected and organized roadside images for training and evaluation.  

2. **Model Implementation**  
   - Integrated the **YOLOv11n** model for accurate and efficient object detection.  
   - Configured the model for detecting multiple object classes present in the dataset.  

3. **Training & Evaluation**  
   - Trained the model on the provided dataset   
   - Evaluated the trained model using metrics like **mean Average Precision (mAP)**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.  

4. **Visualization & Real-time Detection**  
   - Developed scripts to visualize predicted bounding boxes and confidence scores on images and video streams.  
   - Enabled real-time inference to detect objects in live or recorded video feeds.  



### Impact

This project showcases a practical and efficient approach to roadside object detection, providing a foundation for **autonomous navigation, traffic analysis, and safety monitoring systems**.
